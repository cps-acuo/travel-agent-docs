Learn about the features available in the Travel Agent WordPress product.

## Automatic Package Synchronization with Travel Agent Power APP
The Travel Agent WordPress plugin automatically synchronizes travel packages from the [Travel Agent Power APP platform](/docs/travel-agent). This means that whenever a new package is created or an existing package is updated in the Power APP, the changes are reflected in your WordPress site without any manual intervention.

## Automatic Post Creation
When a new travel package is received from the Travel Agent Power APP, the plugin automatically creates a post in WordPress. This post can be created from a template or from scratch, depending on your configuration. The post will include all the relevant information about the travel package, such as title, excerpt, and other details.

## Customizable Booking Button
The plugin provides a customizable booking button that can be added to your travel package posts. This button can be styled to match your site's design and can include text, colors, and icons. When clicked, the button expands to show an iframe with the [booking form](/docs/ta-bookingform), allowing users to book the travel package directly from your site.

# Customizable Booking Form
The [booking form](/docs/ta-bookingform) can be customized to fit your needs. You can adjust the appearance of the form, including colors, corner radius, and borders.

# API
The Travel Agent WordPress plugin provides an API that allows you to interact with the travel packages and bookings programmatically. This API can be used to create, read, update, and delete travel packages.

# Filter Grid
The Travel Agent WordPress plugin includes a filter grid that allows users to easily find and filter travel packages based on three criterias, destination, experience and travel period. This feature enhances the user experience by enabling visitors to quickly locate the packages that best suit their needs.
