description: "Comprehensive overview of the Travel Agent pluginâ€™s REST API, enabling secure and flexible external integrations for managing travel packages and bookings."
---


The Developer API lets you manage travel packages and bookings programmatically. Authenticate using your API key and interact with the following endpoints to create, read, update, and delete data.

## Authentication



All API requests require an API key to be included in the request header:

```http
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
Ensure that your API key is kept secure and never exposed in client-side code.

## Rate Limiting

- Each API key is limited to **100 requests per minute**.
- If this limit is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response header.
