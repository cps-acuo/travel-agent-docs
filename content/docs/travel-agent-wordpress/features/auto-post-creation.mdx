The Travel Agent plugin automatically monitors package creation and update events, ensuring that each travel package is consistently represented by a corresponding WordPress post. This process is fully automated, eliminating the need for manual intervention.


## 1. Trigger Points

- **On New Package:**  
  Triggered when a new package is added in the backend (like Acuo travel Agent Operations).
- **On Package Update:**  
  Triggered when a package is updated and no corresponding post exists.


## 2. Post Creation Logic

### 2.1 Template-Based Creation
1. The plugin checks for a **template_id** associated with the package (e.g., `42`).
2. If a template is present, the structure—including title, shortcodes, and layout—is cloned into a new WordPress post.

### 2.2 Fallback Creation
1. If no template is specified, the plugin generates a **blank post**:
   - **Title:** Uses the package title.
   - **Content:** Includes the excerpt, images, and a default booking button element.

## 3. Post Updating

If an existing package is updated and its corresponding post has been deleted or is missing, the creation logic above is automatically re-executed to restore the post.


## 4. Post Details

- **Content:**  
  Each post includes the package title, excerpt, featured image(s), and a booking button (if specified in the template).
- **Status:**  
  - Packages marked as “Available” are set to `published`.
  - Packages marked as “Draft” or “Pending” are set to `draft`.
- **Visibility:**  
  Determined by the **Post Status** setting in `Settings → Travel Agent`.
- **Taxonomies:**  
  The plugin automatically assigns the following taxonomies:
  - **Destination:** Based on the package destination.
  - **Experience:** Based on the package experience.
  - **Period:** Based on the departure date.


## 5. Configuration

To enable and configure automatic post creation, navigate to **Settings → Travel Agent** in your WordPress admin dashboard:

- **Integration Status:** Set to `Live` to activate automatic post creation and updates.
- **Post Status:** Specify the minimum post status required for frontend visibility (default: `published`).
