description: "How the Travel Agent plugin auto-creates and updates WordPress posts for your packages."
---

The Travel Agent plugin hooks into package **create** and **update** events and ensures each package has a corresponding WordPress post—no manual steps needed.

## 1. Trigger Points

- **On New Package**  
  Runs when a package is first added in the Power APP platform.
- **On Package Update**  
  Runs if a package is updated and no post exists yet.

## 2. Creation Logic

### 2.1 Template-Based
1. Check for a **template_id** on the package (e.g. `42`).
2. If present, clone that template’s structure (title, shortcodes, layout) into a new post.

### 2.2 Fallback
1. If no template is set, generate a **blank post**:
   - **Title**: Uses the package title.
   - **Content**: Includes the excerpt, images, and a default booking button element.
   
## 3. Post Updating

If an existing package is updated **and** its post was deleted or missing, the same logic above re-runs to recreate it automatically.

## 4. Post Details

- **Content**  
  Title, excerpt, featured image(s), and booking button (if your template includes it).  
- **Status**  
  - Maps “Available” packages to `published`.  
  - Maps “Draft” or “Pending” packages to `draft`.  
- **Visibility**  
  Controlled by the **Post Status** setting in `Settings → Travel Agent`.  
- **Taxonomies**  
  Automatically assigns:
  - **Destination** (from package destination)  
  - **Experience** (from package experience)  
  - **Period** (from departure date)  

## 5. Configuration

In **Settings → Travel Agent**:

- **Integration Status** → `Live` (turns this feature on)  
- **Post Status** → Minimum status required for frontend visibility (default: `published`)
