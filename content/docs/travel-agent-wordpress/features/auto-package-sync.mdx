# Package Sync
- Automatically sync packages between the [Power APP platform](/docs/travel-agent) and the WordPress site when changes are made in the Power APP platform.
- This feature ensures that the WordPress site always has the latest package information without manual updates.

- The sync process is triggered by changes in the Power APP platform, such as adding, updating, or deleting packages.
- The plugin handles the synchronization in the background, ensuring that the WordPress site remains up-to-date with the latest package offerings.

- This table includes details such as package name, description, price, and availability.
- Admins can view, edit, or delete packages directly from this table.
- Admins can also run actions on individual packages, such as refreshing the package post data, creating new posts, or deleting old ones.
