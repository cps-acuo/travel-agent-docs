title: Automatic Package Sync
description: Automatically synchronize travel package data between the Backend, and your WordPress site, ensuring real-time updates and seamless content management.
---


## Overview

The Automatic Package Sync feature enables seamless synchronization of travel packages between the Backend, like Travel Agent Operations (/docs/travel-agent), and your WordPress site. Whenever changes are made in the Backend —such as adding, updating, or deleting packages—the plugin automatically updates the WordPress site to reflect the latest information. This process operates in the background, eliminating the need for manual intervention and ensuring your site always displays current package offerings.


## Travel Packages Table

The plugin includes a table within the WordPress admin area, displaying all available travel packages. This table presents key details such as package name, description, price, and availability. Administrators can efficiently view, edit, or delete packages, as well as perform actions on individual packages—such as refreshing post data, creating new posts, or removing outdated entries—directly from the table interface.
