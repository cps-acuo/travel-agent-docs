The Travel Agent booking form is built with **Next.js** and **React**, using **shadcn/ui** components and Tailwind CSS under the hood. It follows a **mobile-first**, fluid layout strategy to ensure optimal usability on all screen sizes.

## Core Principles

- **Mobile-First Breakpoints**  
  Styles begin at the smallest viewport and scale up. Default breakpoints mirror Tailwind’s (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
- **Flexible Containers**  
  The `<BookingForm>` component uses CSS Grid and Flexbox to reorganize fields and buttons based on available width.
- **Fluid Typography & Spacing**  
  Uses relative units (`rem`, `%`) and CSS variables for padding, margins, and font sizes—adjusting automatically between breakpoints.
- **Iframe Responsiveness**  
  The embedded form listens for container width changes (via `ResizeObserver`) and applies matching layout classes.

## shadcn/UI Integration

- **Utility-First**  
  All components leverage Tailwind utility classes for responsive variants (e.g., `md:grid-cols-2`, `lg:px-8`).
- **Configurable Tokens**  
  Customize breakpoints or spacing scales by extending your Tailwind config and rebuilding the form bundle.
