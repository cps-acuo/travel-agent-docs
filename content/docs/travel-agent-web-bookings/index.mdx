The Acuo Travel Agent Web Bookings platform is a SaaS solution built on Node.js, engineered to provide an intuitive, API-driven user experience for travel bookings. Booking results are formatted as JSON and securely transmitted to the backend, ensuring efficient and reliable processing.

This web application is highly configurable via environment variables, enabling seamless integration with the Acuo Travel Agent Operations backend and the Travel Agent WordPress Plugin for enhanced front-end functionality. All API communications utilize the JSON format, facilitating straightforward data exchange and interoperability with other systems.

Access to package information and operations is secured through user authentication, requiring valid login credentials to ensure data privacy and system integrity.
