The Acuo Travel Agent Web Booking application is delivered as a SaaS solution. Upon ordering, the application is deployed and connected to the designated backend system. If the backend is Travel Agent Operations, deployment is performed on Azure App Service.

For Azure App Service deployments, Docker containers are utilized to facilitate efficient management and scalability. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the application, configuring environment variables, and deploying.


## 1. Create & Configure Azure Web App

1. **Create a new Web App** in Azure, selecting **Docker Container** as the publishing option.
2. **Set the Container Registry** to your Azure Container Registry and specify the image name as `tabookingform`.

## 2. Define Environment Variables

In your Web App settings, configure the following environment variables:

| Variable                    | Description                                                                                                        | Example                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**         | Client ID of the App Registration for the Travel Agent Operations Power Apps app.                                  | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`                      |
| **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET**     | Client Secret from the same App Registration.                                                                      | `your-client-secret-value`                                   |
| **AZURE_TENANT_ID**         | Tenant ID of your Azure Active Directory.                                                                          | `yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy`                      |
| **BASE_API_URL**            | Base URL for the Power Apps Operations API.                                                                        | `https://org.crm4.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2`               |
| **POWER_APPS_SCOPE**        | OAuth scope URI for the Power Apps API (append `/.default`).                                                       | `https://org.crm4.dynamics.com/.default`                    |
| **TOKEN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINS** | Interval (in minutes) for refreshing OAuth tokens.                                                             | `15`                                                         |


## 3. Deploy & Verify

1. **Deploy** your container to the Web App.
2. **Restart** the Web App once deployment completes.
3. **Test the root URL:**
   - Visiting `https://<your-webapp>.azurewebsites.net/` should load the default Azure page.
4. **Test the booking form endpoint:**
   - Append `/booking-form` to the URL (e.g., `https://<your-webapp>.azurewebsites.net/booking-form`). You should see a **404 Page Not Found** message, indicating the endpoint is not yet configured.

## 4. Load a Package Form

To render a specific package booking form:

1. Obtain an **External ID** for a published package in the Travel Agent Operations Power Apps platform.
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   https://<your-webapp>.azurewebsites.net/booking-form/<external_id>
   ```
3. The Web Booking application for that package should load (assuming package settings are configured correctly).
