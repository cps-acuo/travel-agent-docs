The Travel Agent booking form is built with **Next.js** and **React**, using **shadcn/ui** components and Tailwind CSS under the hood. It follows a **mobile-first**, fluid layout strategy to ensure optimal usability on all screen sizes.

## Core Principles

- **Mobile-First Breakpoints**  
  Styles are defined using a mobile-first approach, beginning at the smallest viewport and scaling up. Default breakpoints align with Tailwind’s conventions (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
- **Flexible Containers**  
  The `<BookingForm>` component utilizes CSS Grid and Flexbox to dynamically reorganize fields and buttons based on the available width.
- **Fluid Typography & Spacing**  
  Relative units (`rem`, `%`) and CSS variables are used for padding, margins, and font sizes, ensuring automatic adjustment across breakpoints.
- **Iframe Responsiveness**  
  The embedded form detects container width changes using `ResizeObserver` and applies appropriate layout classes for optimal display.

## shadcn/UI Integration

- **Utility-First Approach**  
  All components leverage Tailwind utility classes to support responsive variants (e.g., `md:grid-cols-2`, `lg:px-8`).
- **Configurable Tokens**  
  Breakpoints and spacing scales can be customized by extending your Tailwind configuration and rebuilding the form bundle.
