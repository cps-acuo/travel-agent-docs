The Travel Agent web bookings application provides multi-language support, currently offering built-in localization for **Icelandic** and **English**. This ensures users experience the interface, messages, and data formatting (including numbers, dates, and currencies) in their preferred language and regional format. All UI elements adapt automatically based on the selected locale.

Additional languages will be supported in future releases, guided by market demand.

## Supported Locales

- **English** (`en`)
- **Icelandic** (`is`)


## Automatic Language Detection

1. **Browser Settings**  
   The booking form automatically detects and applies the user’s browser or device language preference.
2. **URL Parameter**  
   Language selection can be explicitly set by appending `bookingform.com/en/` or `bookingform.com/is/` to the URL, overriding automatic detection.


## Localization Details

### UI Text & Labels

- All form labels, button text, validation messages, and notifications are fully translated for each supported language.
- Localization files are managed as JSON dictionaries located under `/locales/{lang}.json`.

### Number Formatting

- **English:** Uses a comma as the thousands separator and a period as the decimal separator (e.g., `1,234.56`).
- **Icelandic:** Uses a space as the thousands separator and a comma as the decimal separator (e.g., `1 234,56`).

### Date & Time

- **English:** Formats dates as `MM/DD/YYYY` or `MMMM D, YYYY`.
- **Icelandic:** Formats dates as `DD.MM.YYYY` or `D. MMMM YYYY`.

### Currency

- **English:** Prefixes the currency symbol (e.g., `1,000.00`).
- **Icelandic:** Suffixes the currency code (e.g., `1.000`).

{/* ## Extending to New Languages

1. **Create** a new JSON file in `/locales/{lang}.json` with translated key/value pairs.  
2. **Add** the locale code to the plugin’s configuration under **Settings → Travel Agent → Booking Form**.  
3. **Test** both automatic detection and manual switching to ensure full coverage.
