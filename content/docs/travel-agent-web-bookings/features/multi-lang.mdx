The Travel Agent booking form web application offers built-in support for **Icelandic** and **English**, ensuring your users see content in their preferred language and format. All UI labels, messages, and data formatting (numbers, dates, currencies) adapt automatically according to the selected locale.

## Supported Locales

- **English** (`en`)
- **Icelandic** (`is`)

## Automatic Language Detection

1. **Browser Settings**  
   The form reads the user’s browser or device language preference and switches accordingly.
2. **URL Parameter**  
   Append `bookingform.com/en/` or `bookingform.com/is/` to override detection.

## Localization Details

### UI Text & Labels

- All form labels, button text, validation messages, and notifications are translated.
- Localization files are managed as JSON dictionaries under `/locales/{lang}.json`.

### Number Formatting

- **English**: Uses comma as thousands separator and period as decimal (e.g. `1,234.56`).
- **Icelandic**: Uses space as thousands separator and comma as decimal (e.g. `1 234,56`).

### Date & Time

- **English**: `MM/DD/YYYY` or `MMMM D, YYYY` formats.
- **Icelandic**: `DD.MM.YYYY` or `D. MMMM YYYY` formats.

### Currency

- **English**: Prefix currency symbol (e.g. `$1,000.00`).
- **Icelandic**: Suffix currency code (e.g. `1 000,00 ISK`).

{/* ## Extending to New Languages

1. **Create** a new JSON file in `/locales/{lang}.json` with translated key/value pairs.  
2. **Add** the locale code to the plugin’s configuration under **Settings → Travel Agent → Booking Form**.  
3. **Test** both automatic detection and manual switching to ensure full coverage.
