Easily tailor the look-and-feel of your embedded booking form by sending style instructions from your page to the iframe via `postMessage`. The booking form supports:

- **Color Overrides**  
  Customize primary, secondary, accent colors, and more to match your theme.
- **Border Radius**  
  Control corner rounding on cards, inputs, and buttons for a cohesive design.

:::note
For a full list of style properties and configuration examples, see the [Booking Form Styling Guide](/docs/travel-agent-web-bookings/configurations/stylings).
:::

```js
// Example: change primary color and border radius
document.getElementById('booking-iframe').contentWindow.postMessage(
  {
    type: 'TA_STYLE_UPDATE',
    styles: {
      '--ta-primary-color': '#0055A4',
      '--ta-border-radius': '8px'
    }
  },
  '*'
);
```

Add these calls on your page before or after rendering the `<iframe>` to apply custom styles instantly.
This works out of the box with the [Travel Agent WordPress plugin](/docs/travel-agent-wordpress), or any custom implementation that uses the booking form iframe.
