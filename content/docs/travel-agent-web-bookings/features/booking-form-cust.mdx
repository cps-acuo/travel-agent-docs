You can fully customize the appearance of your embedded booking form by sending style instructions from your page to the iframe using the `postMessage` API. This approach enables seamless alignment with your site's branding and user experience requirements.

### Supported Customizations

- **Color Overrides**  
  Adjust primary, secondary, accent, and other color variables to match your site's theme.
- **Border Radius**  
  Control the corner radius of cards, input fields, and buttons for a cohesive and modern design.

:::note
For a comprehensive list of supported style properties and configuration examples, refer to the [Booking Form Styling Guide](/docs/travel-agent-web-bookings/configurations/styling).
:::

```js
// Example: Change primary color and border radius
document.getElementById('booking-iframe').contentWindow.postMessage(
  {
    type: 'TA_STYLE_UPDATE',
    styles: {
      '--ta-primary-color': '#0055A4',
      '--ta-border-radius': '8px'
    }
  },
  '*'
);
```

You can invoke these calls on your page either before or after rendering the `<iframe>` to apply custom styles instantly. This functionality is fully supported by the [Travel Agent WordPress plugin](/docs/travel-agent-wordpress) and any custom implementation utilizing the booking form iframe.
