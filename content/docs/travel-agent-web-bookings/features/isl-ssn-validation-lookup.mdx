title: "Icelandic Social Security Number Validation and Lookup"
description: "The Travel Agent booking form provides integrated support for Icelandic social security numbers (kennitala), including real-time format and checksum validation. When enabled, the form can also perform secure lookups to auto-populate user name and address, streamlining the booking process."
---



## Format Validation

- **Pattern Check**  
  The kennitala must conform to the format `DDMMYY-XXXX` or `DDMMYYXXXX` (a 6-digit date followed by a 4-digit sequence).
- **Checksum Verification**  
  The final digit is validated using the modulus-11 algorithm to ensure authenticity.
- **User Feedback**  
  Invalid entries prompt an inline error message, preventing form submission until corrected.


## Optional Lookup

When enabled, the form can securely send the kennitala to your lookup API to retrieve user data and enhance the booking experience 
to lookup names and address from Icelandic central source. 
3. **Auto-Fill**  
   The form automatically populates the name and address fields, minimizing user input and reducing errors.

:::note
Lookup functionality only if you have access to a valid data source and sufficient API quota.
