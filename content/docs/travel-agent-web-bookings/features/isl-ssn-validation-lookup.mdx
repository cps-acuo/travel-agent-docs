description: "Learn about the Icelandic Social Security Number validation and optional lookup features in the booking form."
---

The Travel Agent booking form includes built-in support for Icelandic social security numbers (kennitala). It validates format and checksum at entry time, and—if enabled—can call an external lookup endpoint to fetch the user’s name and address for a smoother booking flow.

## Format Validation

- **Pattern Check**  
  The kennitala must match `DDMMYY-XXXX` or `DDMMYYXXXX` (6-digit date + 4-digit sequence).
- **Checksum**  
  The last digit is verified with the modulus-11 algorithm to ensure authenticity.
- **Client Feedback**  
  Invalid entries trigger an inline error message before submission.

## Optional Lookup

When enabled, the form will send the kennitala to your lookup API to retrieve user data:

1. **Request**  
   POST to `/api/kennitala-lookup/DDMMYYXXXX`.  
   Note: The API endpoint only accepts the `DDMMYYXXXX` format without a hyphen.
2. **Response**  
```json
{
    "name": "Jón Jónsson",
    "permanent_address": {
        "street": {
            "dative": "Lækjargata 2"
        },
        "postal_code": 101,
        "town": {
            "dative": "Reykjavík"
        },
        "country": {
            "type": "country",
            "code": "IS",
            "name": {
                "is": "Ísland",
                "en": "Iceland"
            }
        }
    },
}
```
3. **Auto-Fill**  
   The form populates name and address fields, reducing user effort.

:::note
Enable lookup only if you have a valid data source and sufficient quota.

## Lookup Pricing Template

Use this template to communicate your lookup API pricing plan based on call volume:

| Tier           | Monthly Calls Included | Overage Rate (per call) |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Basic**      | 1,000                  | $0.10                   |
| **Professional** | 10,000                | $0.08                   |
| **Enterprise** | 50,000                 | $0.05                   |

Adjust the tiers, limits, and rates to fit your service model.
