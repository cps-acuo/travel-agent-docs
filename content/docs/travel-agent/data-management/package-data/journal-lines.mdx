This page displays all journal lines related to data management. Journal lines record every change or update made within the system, providing a clear audit trail. Use this overview to review and query specific entries as needed.

Additional users can use this part for uploading data to the system. The journal lines can be used to track changes made to the data, such as adding, updating, or deleting entries. This is especially useful for migration of data into the **Acuo Travel Agent Operation**.
