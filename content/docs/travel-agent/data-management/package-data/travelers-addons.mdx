This page provides an overview of the **Addons** registered for travelers. **Addons** are additional services or features that can be associated with a traveler's booking.
It is possible to link an addon to a specific action that will automatically create an action for that traveler.
Each Addon can also have a price, that is automatically assigned from Package Addons if selected. If no Package Addons is selected, these prices can
be set manually for each traveler addon.
