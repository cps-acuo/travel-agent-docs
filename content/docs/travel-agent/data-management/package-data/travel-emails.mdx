The process of sending the email is as follows:

- The email is generated based on a specific trigger and stage is set to "Ready to Send" or "Edit before sending". 
If the email has "Ready to Send" stage, it will be processed for sending with a flow.  But if the email has "Edit before sending" stage, it will be processed by user to edit the email body and 
then the user needs to change the status to "Ready to Send" for it to be sent out.  

- All emails with the status "Ready to Send" will be processed for sending. If the action is successful, the email's status is updated to "Stage:Sent and Status:Inactive". If there is an error during sending, the status is updated to "Stage:Error and Status:Active".
