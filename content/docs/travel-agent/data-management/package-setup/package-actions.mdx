Travel actions manage the activities of a package or the composition of the trip, particularly the information that the system can provide. 
For example, reports for travel suppliers such as Hotel Report and Flight List.

The information that can be recorded for each action within a package includes:

- Package Actions: Set up actions related to the package, such as flights, hotels, tours, and food & beverage.
- Action Name: Automatically generated if not specified.
- Information: Details about the action, such as description, hotel name, flight number, etc.
- Action: Lookup from Action in setup, allowing grouping by vendor (e.g., airline or hotel chain).
- Auto Register: If enabled, all existing travelers are automatically registered to new actions when posting a travel journal.
- From Date: The date when the action takes place.


A new action for a package needs to be created from the travel package form.  And if a new action is added to a package 
and the Auto Register is enabled then the existing travelers on the package will not be automatically registered to the new action.
