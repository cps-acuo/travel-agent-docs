## Understanding Imported Payments

Imported payments are financial transactions that are brought into the Travel Agent system from external sources, such as:

- Bank statement imports
- Payment gateway transactions
- Third-party booking platform payments
- Bulk payment imports from accounting systems

This feature streamlines the reconciliation process and ensures all payments are properly recorded in the system.

## Managing Imported Payments

After importing payments, you need to:

1. Review the imported transactions for accuracy
2. Match payments to existing bookings or travelers
3. Resolve any unmatched or duplicate payments
4. Generate reconciliation reports
5. Process any payment exceptions or errors
6. Finalize the import by confirming all matched payments

The system maintains an audit trail of all imported payments and their subsequent handling.
