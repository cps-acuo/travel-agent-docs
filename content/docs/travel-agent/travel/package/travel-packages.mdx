# Travel Packages

The Travel Packages section is where you define the trips you'll offer to your customers. From setting itineraries to managing availability, travel packages are central to your operations.

## Key Elements of Travel Packages

- **Name & Dates**: Clearly define the package name and the duration (From Date and To Date).
- **Package Configuration**: Configure actions such as flights, hotels, and tours, as well as booking options.
- **Status Management**: Packages move through stages: "In Preparation", "In Sales", and "Closed".
- **Capacity & Booking**: Manage Max Rooms and Max Pax to control booking limits.
- **Pricing & Payments**: Set payment plans and terms to manage financial aspects.

## Creating & Managing Packages

1. **Create a New Package**: Start by defining trip detailsâ€”name, dates, and main activities.
2. **Configure Options**: Set up booking and website display settings.
3. **Define Pricing**: Establish clear pricing schemes and payment plans.
4. **Manage Availability**: Adjust package maximums and booking requirements based on demand.
5. **Transition Stages**: Move packages through their lifecycle: "In Preparation" to "In Sales" then "Closed" when no longer available.

## Integration with Other Sections

- **Travelers**: Track traveler details linked to specific packages.
- **Travel Bookings**: Coordinate booking logistics related to available packages.
- **Journal**: Document interactions and modifications throughout a package's lifecycle.

This section offers the robust tools you need to effectively manage everything from individual trip offerings to entire catalogs of available journeys.
