A package is essentially a sellable instance of an Item, with the **Item** field controlling certain characteristics. The **Item** and **Name** fields are mandatory when creating a new package.
- **Name**: A descriptive name for the travel package.
- **Item**: The related item, for setting up defaults for the package.

### Main Sections of the Package Form
- **General**: Contains essential information such as name, item, dates, number of nights and days, maximum rooms, and maximum PAX (passengers).
- **Website Booking Options**: Configure web booking details, including package image, minimum PAX per booking, waitlist options, and disclaimers.
- **Website Appearance Settings**: Control how the package appears on your sales website, including display name, excerpt, and automatic updates for availability.
