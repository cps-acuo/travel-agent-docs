### Packages definition
Packages are collections of information required to create bookable events, view bookings, and manage itineraries.
A package is essentially a sellable instance of an Item, with the **Item** field controlling certain characteristics. The **Item** and **Name** fields are mandatory when creating a new package.
- **Name**: A descriptive name for the travel package.
- **Item**: The related item, for setting up defaults for the package.

### Main Sections of the Package Form
- **General**: Contains essential information such as name, item, dates, number of nights and days, maximum rooms, and maximum PAX (passengers).
- **Website Booking Options**: Configure web booking details, including package image, minimum PAX per booking, waitlist options, and disclaimers.
- **Website Appearance Settings**: Control how the package appears on your sales website, including display name, excerpt, and automatic updates for availability.
- **Package Payment Plan**: Set up a payment plan, which may include one or more lines (e.g., deposit and final payment).
    - **Due Dates**: Specify due dates for each payment line.
    - **Type**:
        - **Amount Per Traveler**: A fixed amount due at booking.
        - **Percent**: A percentage of the total amount due on the specified date.
        - **Remainder**: The remaining balance, such as the final payment.
    - **Amount**: Enter the amount or percentage for each payment line.
    - **Payment Method**: Specify how each payment should be collected (modifiable later).
- **Package Actions**: Set up actions related to the package, such as flights, hotels, tours, and food & beverage.
    - **Action Name**: Automatically generated if not specified.
    - **Information**: Details about the action, such as description, hotel name, flight number, etc.
    - **Action**: Lookup from Action in setup, allowing grouping by vendor (e.g., airline or hotel chain).
    - **Auto Register**: If enabled, all existing travelers are automatically registered to new actions when posting a travel journal.
- **Package Prices**: Define pricing for the package, including single (SGL), double (DBL), triple (TRP) occupancy, and more.
- **Addons**: Define actions that are optional, these are called addons. If a package action is assigned, it is automatically linked to travelers who select the addon. Read more about Package Addons [here](../data-management/package-setup/package-addons).
