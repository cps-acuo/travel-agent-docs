### What are Travel Packages?
Travel packages are collections of the basic information needed to create trips, view bookings and manage the itinerary.
These Travel Package inherit information from the **Items** which are templates for Travel Packages. The **Item** field and the **Name** field are the only required fields when creating a new travel package.
- **Name**: A descriptive name for the travel package.
- **Item**: The related item, for setting up defaults for the package.

There are 7 sections in the travel package, which are:
- **General**: This section contains general information about the travel package, such as its name, item, dates, nights, days, max rooms, max PAX etc.
- **Package Payment Plan**: This section allows you to set up a payment plan for the travel package.
- **Package Actions**: This section allows you to add actions to the travel package, such as flights, hotels, tours, food & beverage etc.
- **Website Booking options**: Here you can set up the connection to the Booking Form to your website, if it is installed. Such as the image, the minimum amount of PAX that can be booked together, if you allow waitlisting and some disclaimers.
- **Website Appearance Settings**:
- **Package Prices**:
