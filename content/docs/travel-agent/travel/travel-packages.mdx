### What are Travel Packages?
Travel packages are collections of the basic information needed to create trips, view bookings and manage the itinerary.
These Travel Package inherit information from the **Items** which are templates for Travel Packages. The **Item** field and the **Name** field are the only required fields when creating a new travel package.
- **Name**: A descriptive name for the travel package.
- **Item**: The related item, for setting up defaults for the package.

### There are 7 sections in the travel package, which are:

- **Package Payment Plan**: This section allows you to set up a payment plan for the travel package.
- **Package Actions**: This section allows you to add actions to the travel package, such as flights, hotels, tours, food & beverage etc.
- **Website Booking options**: Here you can set up the connection to the Booking Form to your website, if it is installed. Such as the image, the minimum amount of PAX that can be booked together, if you allow waitlisting and some disclaimers.
- **Website Appearance Settings**: This sections allows you to control how the travel package appears on your sales website, such as it's display name, the excerpt that appears on the travel package and if it should update automatically with information about unbooked pax.
