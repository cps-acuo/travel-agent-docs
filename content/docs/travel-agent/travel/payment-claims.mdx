## Payment Claims Overview

<Steps>
<Step>
### What Are Payment Claims?

Payment claims are formal requests for payment associated with travel bookings. These claims are generated based on the payment schedule defined for each package and can also be created manually as needed.

### Creating a New Payment Claim

Payment claims are typically generated automatically during the booking process, in accordance with the packageâ€™s payment setup. However, claims can also be created manually for any booking, provided they are linked to a specific booking record.

To create a manual payment claim:
1. Navigate to the relevant booking.
2. Select the payment/claims section and click **New Claim**.
3. Enter the claim amount and any supporting details as required.

The system will generate a unique claim reference number for tracking and management purposes.
