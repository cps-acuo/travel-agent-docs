## Managing the Claims Process

Once payment claims are created, you can:

- Track the status of each claim through its lifecycle
- Send automated reminders for outstanding claims
- Generate queries on outstanding claims
- Mark as claims paid
- For marking claims as paid you only need to check on paid, then data paid and amount paid will automatically be updated.

<Step>
Claims that have been sent out for collection (process depends on the payment method) but need to be adjusted then, like changing payment-mehod, due date, payer information,
then ***ClaimId***, ***Claim Send Date*** needs cleared and then the claim transaction is able to be resent with new process or information for collection.  

If the users likes to Multi-select lines for clearing these claims they can do so by selecting the relevant claims (many) and then assigning the text "N/A" to the filed ClaimId and press save. 
This will clear the ClaimId and Claim Send Date fields, allowing for a fresh start on the claim process.
