## Understanding Payment Claims

Payment claims are requests for payment related to travel bookings. These may include:

- Claims to suppliers for services rendered
- Claims to insurance companies for covered incidents
- Claims to partners for commission payments
- Claims to customers for outstanding balances

The payment claims module helps track and manage these financial requests throughout their lifecycle.
