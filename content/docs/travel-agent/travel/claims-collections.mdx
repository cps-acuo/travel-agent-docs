## Managing the Claim Collection

Once a claim collection is created, you can view the individual claims associated with it in the section bellow the collection details.

But first, you need to Prepare the claims by pressing the **Prepare Claims** button in the command bar. This will validate the claims and prepare them for processing. 
If there are any validation errors, they will be displayed in the **Validation result** field. You can then correct the issues and re-prepare the claims.


After preparing the claims, you can proceed to process them by clicking on the **Post Collection Journal** button, next to the **Prepare Claims** button.
This will process the claims and send emails to the customers associated with the claims, notifying them of the claim status and any actions required.
