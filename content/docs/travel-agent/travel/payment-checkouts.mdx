## Navigating to the Payment Checkouts Page

To access the Payment Checkouts page, click on the **Payment Checkouts** link in the sidebar. This will take you to the main overview of all checkout requests.

## How Checkout Requests Work

Checkout requests are generated automatically through the following process:

1. A payment claim email is sent to the customer
2. The customer clicks the payment link in their email
3. They are redirected to an external checkout page (configured in the [Payment Methods](/docs/travel-agent/setup/payment-methods) section)
4. The system records this checkout attempt

Each time a customer clicks the payment link to start the checkout process, the system logs the attempt and updates the relevant information.

## Checkout Request Information

Each checkout request entry contains the following information:

- **Created On**: The date and time when the checkout request was initially created
- **Tries Counter**: The number of times the customer has attempted to pay by clicking the link in the email
- **Is Paid**: Whether the payment has been successfully completed
- **Payment Order ID**: The packageorderpayment identifier associated with this checkout
- **Payer**: The person or entity making the payment
- **Travel Package**: The specific travel package for which payment is being made
- **Payment Method**: The selected method of payment for this transaction

## Understanding the Tries Counter

The Tries Counter is an important metric that shows how many times a customer has attempted to initiate the payment process. Each time a customer clicks the payment link in their email, this counter increases. This can help you identify:

- Customers who may be having difficulties completing the payment process
- Potential technical issues with the payment gateway
- Payment claims that may need follow-up attention
