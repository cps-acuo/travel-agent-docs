## Creating a new Traveler
To add a new traveler, usually users are expected to create them through the **[Journal](./journal)** page when you get or create a journal. Which is supposed to be a sort of entry way into creating bookings.
However, you can also create a travelers directly from the Bookings page by clicking on the **New Traveler** button in the associated lookup grid when editing a booking.
That way you can create a traveler and already have them associated with a booking.
