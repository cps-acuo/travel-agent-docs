## Overview

Security roles in Travel Agent Operations define what users can access and what actions they can perform within the application. There are three primary security roles, each designed for different levels of access and responsibility.

**Typical Users:**
- System Administrators
- Business Process Owners
- IT Staff responsible for application management

## Best Practices

<Callout type="info">
  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Always assign the minimum level of access required for users to perform their job functions. Start with more restrictive roles and expand access only when necessary.
</Callout>

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly review user access and remove unnecessary permissions
- Document which users have which roles and why
- Use [Column Security Profiles](./column-security-profiles) in addition to security roles to protect sensitive data
- Test role assignments in a non-production environment before applying them to production
- Maintain an audit trail of security role changes

<Callout type="warn">
  **Security Note:** When users have multiple security roles, they receive the combined permissions of all assigned roles. Be careful when assigning multiple roles to avoid unintentionally granting excessive access.
