## Overview

Security in Travel Agent Operations is managed through two main components:

1. **Security Roles** - Define what users can do within the application
2. **Column Security Profiles** - Control access to sensitive data fields

These security features ensure that users only have access to the data and functionality they need to perform their job responsibilities.

  Security settings are typically configured during the initial setup and should be reviewed regularly to ensure they align with your organization's security policies.
