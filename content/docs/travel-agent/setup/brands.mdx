## Defining the Brand Details

In the **New Brand** window, you need to fill in the details for the brand. This page is divided into two main sections: **Web Page Connection** and **Payment Link**.

### Web Page Connection
This section is used to manage connections to different WordPress websites. You can also configure a **Help Text** field that will be displayed on the booking form.

### Payment Link
This section allows you to configure the email settings for payment links:
- **Email From**: The email address that will appear as the sender.
- **Email Signature Logo**: A URL to an image that will be used as the logo in the email signature.
- **Brand Email Signature**: The text that will appear at the end of the email.
- **Link Text**: The text that will be displayed for the payment link instead of the full URL.
