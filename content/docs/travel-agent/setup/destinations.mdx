## Creating a New Destination

To create a new destination, click on the **New** button in the command bar. This will open the form for a new destination. The most important fields are:
- **Destination Name**
- **City**
- **Country**
- **Web Term Name**

Once you have entered the required information, you can save the new destination.

The Web Term Name is used to identify the destination for taxonomy purposes, such as in what category it belongs to on your website and it's important for the WordPress integration to work correctly.
