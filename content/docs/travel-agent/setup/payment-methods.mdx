## Navigating to the Payment Methods Page

The main **Payment Methods** page provides an overview of all existing payment methods within the system. From here, you can view, manage, and create new payment methods.

## Defining the Payment Method Details

In the **New Payment Method** window, you need to fill in the details for the payment method. For most payment methods, you will provide a name and select the type. 

Under the **Credit Card Service** section, there are additional fields for configuring the **Straumur Payment Link** integration:
- **Access URL**: The main endpoint for Straumur Services.
- **Returning URL**: The URL where the customer will be redirected after finishing the payment process.
- **Session Lifetime**: How long the payment session will remain active. If the session expires, a new one will be created with the same lifetime.
- **Theme Key**: Used to customize the appearance of the payment page which is configured at the **Straumur** merchant portal.

You can also configure the **Payment Email URL**, which is the link that appears in the email body. The Power App will concatenate an ID to this link (usually you would put the Booking Form checkout endpoint).

The **Email Template** is a rich text field that allows you to customize the email content. You can use the following placeholders, which must be typed exactly as shown, to insert dynamic information:
- `<PackageName>`
- `<Amount>`
- `<Link>`
- `<Companysign>`
- `<Companylogo>`

These placeholders will be replaced with the relevant information when the email is sent. The dynamic content for `<Companysign>` and `<Companylogo>` is configured in the [Brands section](/docs/travel-agent/setup/brands).
