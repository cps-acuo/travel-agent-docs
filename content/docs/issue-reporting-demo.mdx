# Issue Reporting Demo

This page demonstrates the various ways users can report issues with the Travel Agent documentation.

## Report Issue Button Locations

### 1. Navigation Bar
There's a compact issue button in the top navigation bar that's available on every page.

### 2. Sidebar Footer
Check out the sidebar on the left - there's an issue reporting section at the bottom.

### 3. Inline Components
You can also add issue buttons directly in your documentation content:

<ReportIssue variant="default" />

Or use the compact version:

<ReportIssue variant="compact" />

### 4. Page Footer
There's also a page footer component that can be added to specific pages:

<PageFooter />

## How It Works

When you click any of these issue buttons:

1. **Automatic URL Detection**: The current page URL is automatically captured
2. **Pre-filled Form**: Opens GitHub with a pre-filled issue form
3. **Template Structure**: Uses our custom issue template with relevant fields
4. **Context Preservation**: Includes the page URL and space for screenshots

## Issue Template Features

Our GitHub issue template includes:
- Page URL (automatically filled)
- Issue type dropdown
- Product selection (Travel Agent Operations, WordPress Plugin, Web Bookings)
- Detailed description field
- Screenshots upload area
- Browser/device information
- Code of conduct acceptance

## Usage in MDX

To add issue buttons to your documentation pages, simply use:

```mdx
<ReportIssue variant="default" />
<ReportIssue variant="compact" />
<PageFooter />
```

The buttons will automatically detect the current page and generate the appropriate GitHub issue URL.
