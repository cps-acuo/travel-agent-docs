# Overview

**Acuo Travel Agent** is a comprehensive, cloud-based platform purpose-built for group bookings and travel management. Featuring a robust backend and advanced automation capabilities, the platform seamlessly integrates with both WordPress and Node.js web applications. This enables organizations to streamline operations, optimize workflows, and deliver superior booking experiences.

## Modular Product Architecture

Acuo Travel Agent is architected as three distinct, interoperable modules. Each module operates independently and can be integrated as needed to create a tailored solution:

1. **Operations:**
   A fully featured backend for managing package bookings and related activities. The core intellectual property is a model-driven Power App, empowering users to extend functionality and implement advanced automation with ease.

2. **Web Bookings:**
   A SaaS website (Node.js-based) that provides visitors with an intuitive, API-driven user interface. Booking results are formatted as JSON and securely transmitted to the backend for processing.

3. **WordPress Plugin:**
   A specialized plugin that enables WordPress designers to create and manage content supporting package offerings and bookings. It provides extensive taxonomy support from the backend system and extends the Elementor designer with custom components for:
   - Taxonomy-based post searching
   - Booking packages using Acuo Travel Agentâ€™s web booking engine
   The plugin also includes an API for real-time updates of package availability and related data on the WordPress site.
