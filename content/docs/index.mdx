# Overview 
**Acuo-Travel Agent** is a cloud-based platform designed for group bookings and management. With a robust backend, advanced automation tools. The platform seamlessly integrates with both WordPress and Node.js web applications, allowing businesses to streamline operations and optimize workflows for maximum productivity.
Modular Product Architecture
The product is divided into three distinct parts, each of which run independently and can be integrated to best fit the overall solution:
1.	Operations:
A fully functional backend for managing package bookings and associated activities. The core IP is a model-driven Power App, supporting citizen developers in extending its functionality and enabling advanced automation.
2.	Web Bookings: A website (based on Node.js, delivered as a SaaS product) provides visitors with a smartly designed user interface where inputs and layout are controlled via API.  After booking, the results are formatted as JSON and sent to the backend using a web service.
  
3.	WordPress Plugin: An IP component that enables WordPress designers to create and manage content supporting package offerings and bookings. It offers extensive taxonomy support from the backend system and extends the Elementor designer with custom components for:
    - Searching posts based on taxonomy
    - Booking packages (using Acuo Travel Agentâ€™s web booking capabilities)


    The plugin also includes an API for updating the WordPress site with package availability status and more.
